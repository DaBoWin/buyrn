## Preparations
1. First, log in to RN on Chrome, ensuring that the Tampermonkey script is enabled.
2. The script code needs to set the product ID to be purchased, which is the pid, and then click to save.
3. Access the RN product link via Chrome, for example:https://my.racknerd.com/cart.php?a=add&pid=5999
